okay so priorities (in order) are:
1. Delete functionality
2. Admin pages need to be shoved into the views somehow but idk how to call them? or where to put them? This needs to be done sooner than later because I have a feeling ill need to do some funky css to fix incompatibility between the user side and the admin side stylesheets....... and i wont have much time to do that tomorrow if you leave it too long :eyes: 
3. Back buttons
4. Edit 
5. literally everything else
